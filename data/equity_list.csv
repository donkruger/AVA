As an ""autocallable"" product, it has the feature of early redemption or ""autocall"" if certain performance conditions are met at predefined observation dates. If the underlying assets meet or exceed specific thresholds, the product may mature early, and investors receive a predetermined payout. If conditions for autocall are not met, the investment continues until the next observation date or maturity. This product typically appeals to investors seeking exposure to market-linked returns with the potential for early exit, while also accepting certain risks associated with structured products."
