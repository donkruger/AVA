'''
üåê AgentTwo Class - Risk Profiling Agent for Interactive Financial Advisory App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Overview:
AgentTwo functions as a risk profiling agent within the advisory app's agentic pipeline. It is responsible 
for analyzing the user‚Äôs conversation history and generating a detailed risk profile report. This agent 
retrieves a predefined mandate from an external text file, guiding its interpretation of the user‚Äôs 
interaction history. By combining the mandate with the conversation details, AgentTwo produces a 
comprehensive risk profile, enabling the app to provide personalized investment advice based on the 
user's risk tolerance and financial goals. This profiling step is crucial for tailoring advice to individual 
client profiles.

In Simple Terms:
AgentTwo is a specialized agent that reads through the user‚Äôs conversation and creates a risk profile 
report. This report helps the app understand the user‚Äôs comfort with risk, so it can offer advice that fits 
their financial preferences. AgentTwo uses a set of rules (mandate) and the user‚Äôs words to make this 
profile, making it a key part of personalizing the advice given.

Attributes:
- Inherits all attributes from AgentBase, including model_name, api_key, and prompter.

Methods:
- get_mandate: Retrieves the agent‚Äôs risk profiling criteria from a text file, outlining how to interpret 
  conversation history.
- generate_risk_profile: Combines the mandate with the user‚Äôs conversation history, creating a prompt 
  to generate a detailed risk profile report, which informs the app about the user‚Äôs risk tolerance.
