'''
üåê AgentBase Class for Interactive Financial Advisory App
---------------------------------------------------------
Technical Overview:
This is the foundational class for all agents in the advisory app‚Äôs pipeline. It manages the configuration and
setup of agents by handling model loading and serves as a template for mandate retrieval and input processing.
The class is designed to be subclassed, with specific mandates and processing behaviors defined by each agent 
subclass. The load_model method initializes the LLM model, while get_mandate and process_input methods act as 
placeholders for subclass-specific implementations.

In Simple Terms:
AgentBase is like a blueprint for agents in the app! It helps each agent get ready by loading the right model
and leaves room for each agent to specify its own rules (mandates) and actions. Think of it as a starter kit 
for agents to be easily added to the app with unique capabilities.

Attributes:
- model_name: The name of the LLM model each agent will use.
- api_key: Access key for LLM model requests.
- prompter: Instance of the loaded model to manage interactions with user inputs.

Methods:
- __init__: Initializes model configuration.
- load_model: Loads the chosen model using LLMWare‚Äôs API.
- get_mandate: Placeholder for mandate retrieval (to be defined by each agent).
- process_input: Placeholder for input processing (to be defined by each agent).
