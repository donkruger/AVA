ðŸ“Š ResearchManager Class - Financial Data Retrieval and Summary Generation for Advisory App
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Overview:
The ResearchManager class is responsible for gathering and summarizing financial data on companies 
to support investment advice within the advisory app. It processes a CSV file of company data, filters 
companies based on financial health (e.g., Piotroski F-Score), and retrieves additional financial metrics 
from Yahoo Finance via the YFinance API. The generate_research_summary method compiles these 
data points into a detailed research summary, while the summarize_report method provides a concise 
overview using an LLM. This setup allows the app to deliver informed, data-driven insights to users.

In Simple Terms:
The ResearchManager is like the appâ€™s financial data researcher. It reads a list of companies, picks the 
strongest ones, and gathers extra details from Yahoo Finance. Then it makes a summary of these details, 
so the app can give users well-researched investment advice without overwhelming them with too much 
information.

Attributes:
- None specific to this class; it relies on session state for configurations and API key.

Methods:
- generate_research_summary: Compiles a comprehensive report on selected companies, including 
  financial metrics and company information from Yahoo Finance.
- summarize_report: Converts the research summary into a concise, user-friendly report using an LLM 
  to ensure clarity and relevance in user interactions.
