ðŸ“ˆ RiskProfileManager Class - Risk Profile Generation for Advisory App
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Overview:
The RiskProfileManager class manages the generation of user-specific risk profiles within the advisory 
app. It utilizes AgentTwo to analyze conversation history and produce a detailed report reflecting the 
userâ€™s risk tolerance and financial disposition. The generate_risk_profile method initiates AgentTwo 
with the appropriate model and API key, leveraging conversation data to create a comprehensive risk 
profile report. This report helps tailor investment advice to each user's unique risk appetite.

In Simple Terms:
The RiskProfileManager is like the appâ€™s risk analyst. It takes what the user has shared in the 
conversation and asks AgentTwo to create a report that shows how much financial risk the user is 
comfortable with. This report is used to give advice that matches the userâ€™s risk preferences.

Attributes:
- None specific to this class; it relies on session state for agent configuration.

Methods:
- generate_risk_profile: Initiates AgentTwo to create a risk profile based on conversation history, 
  helping the app customize advice according to user-specific risk tolerance.
